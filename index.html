	    <h2 id="Abstract">Abstract</h2>
	    <p>
        	I checked in for the night at Out O The Way motel. What a bad choice that was. First I took a shower and a spider crawled out of the drain. Next, the towel rack fell down when I reached for the one small bath towel. This allowed the towel to fall halfway into the toilet. I tried to watch a movie, but the remote control was sticky and wouldn’t stop scrolling through the channels. I gave up for the night and crawled into bed. I stretched out my leg and felt something furry by my foot. Filled with fear, I reached down and to my surprise, I pulled out a raccoon skin pair of underwear. After my initial relief that it wasn’t alive, the image of a fat, ugly businessman wearing raccoon skin briefs filled my brain. I jumped out of the bed, threw my toothbrush into my bag, and sprinted towards my car.

        	What are message queues? It’s as simple as it sounds, queues in which messages are stored. If you look at your phones you will see emails all piled up for you to look at your leisure. That’s what message queue is. Another example and a good way to look at it is when you go to a café. Let’s say a customer wants some coffee, He goes up to the cashier and orders. For this to work effectively, The cashier cannot go to the back and start making coffee and wait for coffee to be made. especially when there are queues behind the customer. Sho will take the orders? It’s not efficient at all. For a message queue to work, we need asynchronous processing, allowing the cashier to take the next order without delay. Persistence to ensure the customer’s orders are not missed if a problem occurs.

			Here's a simple diagram of message queue architecture. The cashier registers orders into a queue. The cashier is then free to take as many orders as he wants without any delays, while the coffee maker picks up new orders in batches. Once an order is complete, the coffee maker marks the order as done in the database. After, the customer can come collect the coffee at the counter at their leisure. There is no wasted time between the actions of workers whom we can refer to as ‘broker’.
For large companies that need messaging systems, few key factors are considered: Scalability, Flexibility, Reliability, and efficiency.

        	Generative AI, incorporating the use of large language model-based chatbots such as ChatGPT and 
			image generative technology such as DALL-E 2, is resurrecting the dead using digital traces left behind.

        	It was clear that the market needed a message queue product that can fully implement the AMQP protocol. Rabbit Technologies was co-founded by Alexis and Matthias in 2007 [17]. In the same year, the company launched RabbitMQ, the first message queue product that fully implements AMQP protocol. In 2010, the company was acquired by VMware [18]. RabbitMQ is developed in Erlang programming language with exceptional performance and low latency in the microsecond range. Because of its full support for AMQP, it is more open and able to support more applications for integrated access than commercial products such as IBM MQ and ActiveMQ which implemented JMS. In addition, compared with other contemporary products of AMQP implementation such as Apache Qpid [19], RabbitMQ’s multi-language client and technical documents are more standardized and sounder, and its open source community is more active [20][21]. This made RabbitMQ increasingly an ideal choice for message exchange in small, medium, and even large enterprises. In fact, RabbitMQ is still one of the most successful open source message queues in the world to this day.

		<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
	    <p>
        	Enterprises have produced more and more data ever since the birth of the Internet. In 2010, the arrival of the mobile Internet made the Internet, a super entrance, fully accessible and popular. In that year, there were 1.97 billion Internet users in the world, accounting for 28.7% of the global population [23]. Therefore, Internet enterprises had to deal with more data. As a global social networking site with more than 90 million members in 2010 [24], LinkedIn needed to analyze the behaviors of Internet users through a large number of logs every day for product optimization and advertisement serving. The basic paradigm of big data analytics, Lamdba [25,26], collects data from many systems through data acquisition components and then gathers it to big data platforms such as Spark or Hadoop. User behavior log data is obtained through distributed acquisition program. How to transfer massive log data to Hadoop which can realize the batch analysis of a large amount of data became a key issue [27]. LinkedIn used to transfer logs via ActiveMQ in the data integration scenario, but the performance problems of ActiveMQ laid bare against the big data integration scenario. Despite its complete message mechanism, flexible configuration methods and secure message delivery assurance, it was incapable for LinkedIn’s massive data transfer [28]. The big data integration scenario requires rapid transfer of massive log data to the big data platforms, which does not require complex configuration and the support of AMQP protocol. High-throughput transmission products were the most needed, which was not achievable by AcitveMQ.
